# Requirements

The system requirements define the functional and non-functional aspects that the text-to-audio conversion system must meet. These requirements guide the development process, ensuring that the system meets the user's needs and expectations.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Text-to-Audio Conversion**: The system must generate audible audio from text inputs.

2. **Integration**: The system must integrate seamlessly with existing virtual assistant infrastructures.

3. **Language Support**: The system must support generating audio in Portuguese.

4. **Voice Customization**: Users must be able to choose and customize voices for their needs.

5. **Dynamic Intonation**: The system must adjust intonation to emphasize keywords in responses.

6. **Emotion Adaptation**: The system should modify the voice's tone based on conversational context.

7. **Multi-Format Text Support**: Inputs in HTML, Markdown, plain text, and emails must be processed effectively.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The system must generate responses in under 1.5 seconds.

2. **Scalability**: It must support multiple simultaneous users without degradation.

3. **Availability**: The system must be operational 99% of the time.

4. **Clarity**: The generated audio must be clear and easy to understand.

5. **Naturalness**: Voices must sound natural and human-like, avoiding robotic tones.

6. **Redundancy**: Mechanisms should ensure uninterrupted service even in case of failures.

7. **Maintainability**: The system must have modular, well-documented code for easy updates.

8. **Multilingual Capability**: It should support multiple languages to cater to diverse markets.

9. **Legal Compliance**: All voices used must adhere to licensing and copyright laws.

## Constraints

1. **Integration with Virtual Assistants**: The system must integrate seamlessly with existing virtual assistants, preserving user experience.

2. **Independent Deployment**: It must operate autonomously without third-party dependencies.
