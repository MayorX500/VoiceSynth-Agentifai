# Closing Notes
## To whom it may concern

This project is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community.
This project was developed by a team of students from the University of Minho, as part of the curricular unit: 14602 - Informatics Project for the course [Master's in Informatics Engineering](https://www.uminho.pt/EN/education/educational-offer/Cursos-Conferentes-a-Grau/_layouts/15/UMinho.PortalUM.UI/Pages/CatalogoCursoDetail.aspx?itemId=5067&catId=15).

The project was developed under the supervision of [Professor João Miguel Fernandes](https://www.di.uminho.pt/~jmf/) and [Professor Victor Manuel Rodrigues Alves](https://www.di.uminho.pt/~vma/), with a proposal from [Agentifai](https://agentifai.com/) to create a high-quality, low-latency, and modular TTS system for their virtual assistant.

We would also like to thank our Agentifai mentor João Cunha for his guidance and support throughout the project.
